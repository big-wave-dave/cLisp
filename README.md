# cLisp
A silly lisp implemented in C to help me learn some of the concepts of language development.

This is my implementation of Daniel Holden's tutorial "Build Your Own Lisp" at buildyourownlisp.com. My formatting is a little different, I implemented things a little differently in some places (just a personal preference kind of deal), and added a lot of comments, but all in all it was a great tutorial and a great way to become more familiar with C and put myself in the shoes (at least a tiny bit!) of language developers. Major kudos and thanks to him.
